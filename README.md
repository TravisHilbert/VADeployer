# Additional Notes
The Virtual Assistant deployed is based on Virtual Assistant Template v4.6.0.1

## Azure regions
This will deploy a virtual assistant to the WestUS Azure region by default and also assumes your LUIS authoring key is in the westus. If you wish to deploy to a different region the deployment script has additional parameters to override the defaults.
